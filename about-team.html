                        We work closely with the BJJ and Muay Thai clubs. If you come for judo, you are free to practice any of the three sports as we all practice together in the same building at the same time!

                    <p class="hidden">
                        NO! We ask you to sign a waiver when you show up to your first practice, but you do not need any special gear for your first few practices. Bring a friend too and have some fun!
