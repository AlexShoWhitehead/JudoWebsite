# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Meet minimum once a week to compare our plans
    - Constantly pitch constructive edits to the team
    - Create an interactive dynamic website for our client
    - Work well as a team to evenly contribute

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    - Do not interrupt a group member while they are speaking
    - Notify the group chat before and after each addition to the team folder
    - Each member shall contribute to both design and coding proportionally to their strengths
    - Encourage all opinions on all topics
    - Give everyone the opportunity for equal participation
    - Be open to new approaches and listen to new ideas
    - Avoid placing blame when things go wrong
3. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    The client knows a member of the group well, so:
    - Once a week, the client will be notified of any design changes and updates
    - This will be done either through an email or a Zoom meeting, whichever method works better for the client

4. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

    - Client Communicator
      - Communicate with the client to identify their objectives and needs plus collect content
    - Interviewer/ Audience Communicator
      - Communicate with the target audience and gain insight
    - Content Organizer
      - Find example websites
      - Organize the necessary content into pages and on the pages
    - Aesthetic Organizer
      - Create the color scheme and aesthetic look of the website (font type, color, etc)
    - Wide and Narrow designer
      - Create the wide and narrow designs
    - Interactivity Organizer
    - Team organizer


5. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    - Constantly update the group chat if unable to meet a deadline
    - "Hey we see that you haven't done X, do you need some help completing it?"

6. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    - We try to find a compromise if possible. If this is not possible, we work as a group to decide the best answer

7. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    At our weekly group meetings, we go over the contract and add or remove any new information

8. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    - At milestone completion we can take 2 days off to relax.

9. When will our work be done?

    - MINIMUM by noon the day the milestone is due. If it is not done the member will be contacted and if they need help one other member who is free will assist them

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
