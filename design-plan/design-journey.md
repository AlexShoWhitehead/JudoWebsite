# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

We were between a film group which is run by a friend of one of the group members and a sports club run by a friend of a different group member. Ultimately, we chose our client as the Cornell University Judo Club. Furthermore, the client is not a member of our group although one does know them.

The client is an on campus organization that does not have a current easily usable website. The website was last updated over 10 years ago and is not interactive. Our goal is to redesign the existing site, however rather than maintain the previous code we are rebuilding it from scratch but making sure the new site contains all of the content from the previous site.

Original Site URL: [Judo Website](https://cornelljudo.wordpress.com/)

Major Pages:

- ![Main page](judo-main-page.png)
- ![About page](judo-about-page.png)
- ![Practice Page](judo-practice-page.png)
- ![Email Page](judo-email-page.png)

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

6. What are your goals for this site?

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

    To do this we examined the previous website together with the client. Using the information from the client and the previous website we decided that the idea of the club has not changed since the previous website was created. As such, the purpose is to teach Judo to Cornell students and Ithaca residents of all skill levels and ages.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

    It is the only gym between Binghamton and Syracuse. It has club members from around the world due to it being related to Cornell University. Some current members are from Ithaca, Germany, Korea, and Hawaii. It is one of the oldest Judo clubs in the nation dating back over 40 years.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

    The design and structure of the current website is outdated and difficult to navigate; the information in the website is not very pleasant to read or user-friendly. The client wants the design to be more modern and the important content to be more available.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

    The client wants prospective Judo club members who are interested in joining the club to visit our site. Thus, our website's intended audience is prospective Judo Club members from the Cornell and general Ithaca community who are looking to join a judo club.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    Users can browse through infomation of the club such as practice, member bios, and sending emails and perspective intention of joining the club. The client mainly wants people to be able to find out current information about the club (for example shirt sales or club practice cancellations or times).

6. What are your goals for this site?

    The website's goal is to introduce the Cornell Judo Club's info to the audience, inspire new members to join, record daily activities of the club, and share Judo culture to the audience.

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    The color palette would be mainly blue and white, the whole feeling would be more modern. This should match the themes as featured in some of the websites below that we looked up together.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

    The three favorite competitors or similar organizations are Pedro's Judo Center, United States Judo Association and Kodokan Judo. Because the website does a good job on showing judo culture and engaging with the community

    - ![Pedros](https://pedrosjudo.com/)
    - ![USJA](https://www.usja.net/)
    - ![Kodokan](http://kodokanjudoinstitute.org/en/doctrine/)


### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

For our website, we want to design a site that fulfils the wants of the client. As such, our content will be our number one priority as well as its aesthetics. The client wants a website that mimics other judo sites as well so we will take a modern blue and white look into account. The Pedro site uses red accents so that is something we can incorporate as well.  The purpose of the site is to spread important information to the audience and bring them into the club. It is also to let potential new members reach out to the club to join. We decided to have a main page/updates page, an about us and info page, a practice and members page, and a contact us page. These pages will look substantially different than before but have the same info. Also the home and about pages before were the same so we are changing this. Due to these changes, rather than update a pre existing site, we opted to start from scratch. The images of the site can be seen here.

Original Site URL: [Judo Website](https://cornelljudo.wordpress.com/)

- ![Main page](judo-main-page.png)
- ![About page](judo-about-page.png)
- ![Practice Page](judo-practice-page.png)
- ![Email Page](judo-email-page.png)

For our site we plan to use the same original content with some new images provided by the client. We will make the site more modern and the content more accessible. We will also include an important info/ updates section.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Modernize existing website
- Draw in potential new members
- Give updates to existing and new members
- Allow new members to contact the club
- Have club information for all members


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

- As we have four team members we will shoot to complete the four sample pages we took from the initial website (home, about, practice, and email). We will do this by separating the current home page into a home page and an about/fax page. There are also several other pages which are highly interactive and beyond the scope of this assignment (a blog page and contact us PHP page). There is some content from these pages that can be added to our four pages, however. The four pages follow closely the original site and so it is the perfect size for our client. As it is the right size for our client it is good for this project. Furthermore we will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to follow the criteria of the project.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the site's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

Milestone 2 is due November 16th. It includes the drafts for the website's design and content placement. This closely copies our other projects initial milestones. Furthermore, we will begin our HTML and, time permitting, CSS.

For next week, we will have a design plan including a card sort and general layout design for both narrow and wide screens. Furthermore, the interview will be completed by then. By completing all design aspects and pre-draft aspects by next week, we will have an entire week to code our website. Furthermore, time permitting, we will add further design to our website by adding CSS.

As our final submission is the site that will be interactive, given our website is mostly done and our draft is done well we can spend time working on our interactivity and finishing the website for our final submission.

So, in conclusion:

By 11/4 we will have the design draft done as well as the interviews and goal analysis.

By 11/11, we will have our HTML and CSS draft done and our site assembled by each focusing on a single page (although ensuring the theme stays consistent across the site), and we will continue editing them until the final deadline on 11/16, to set us up well for solely working on interactivity and design updates for the final submission on 11/30.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** "Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am designing the website for the Cornell Judo Club. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time."

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

2. Recall the last time you attempted to join a club. What information was most important to helping you join?

3. Recall the last time you attempted to join a club. How did you find out where the club was meeting and at what time?

4. What do you know about the sport of Judo?
5. How does knowing more about the sport of Judo impact your willingness to join the club?

6. How do you typically receive information about clubs in which you are involved?

7. Recall the last time you wanted to join a club. What aspects of the club made you interested in joining?

8. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

### Interview Notes (Milestone 2)
> Interview at least 1 person for every member of your team from your audience.
> Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.
> **Copy the interview questions above into each interviewee section below.**
> Take notes for each participant inline with the questions.

**Interviewee 1:**

Previously practiced Judo when very young. A good fit for the key audience of the club.

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

    This interviewee is an Undergraduate Sophomore and is male. They practiced judo when they were young however stopped as they got older due to other activities.

2. Recall the last time you attempted to join a club. What information was most important to helping you join?

    The time and days of the week the club met. Also where the club meets because sometimes clubs do not list the location. It is useful to know what exactly one needs to bring for the club because some clubs especially sports do not tell you the equipment list. It would be useful to have contact information as well.

3. Recall the last time you attempted to join a club. How did you find out where the club was meeting and at what time?

    They met the club president at ClubFest and learned the times and location that way. It is important to know the time and location because in case it is hard to contact the club they could always go in person.

4. What do you know about the sport of Judo?

    The interviewee practiced for several years and has a reasonably high knowledge level of Judo.

5. How does knowing more about the sport of Judo impact your willingness to join the club?

   Not much because this interviewee already had experience. The only reason they hadn't joined yet is because they are too busy but learning more would not help.

6. How do you typically receive information about clubs in which you are involved?

    Typically the clubs they am in send out a weekly email or list serv of some sort.

7. Recall the last time you wanted to join a club. What aspects of the club made you interested in joining?

    Usually the overall vibe of the club. If the club is on an interesting topic that helps too. A lack of contact makes them want to join the club less.

8. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

    Maybe about other things that could be included. Interviewee mentioned many sports clubs require waivers which is important info to have on the site.


**Interviewee 2:**

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

    An undergraduate senior with a background in martial arts but not judo.

    Asked a friend who was currently in the club.

4. What do you know about the sport of Judo?

    Not too much. Cross trained in Sambo and BJJ so some background in grappling but not tons of information about judo itself.

5. How does knowing more about the sport of Judo impact your willingness to join the club?

    Probably more likely to join. Usually joins based on interest in the subject so if judo seems interesting they are more likely to join.

    Not sure, seems pretty good overall.

**Interviewee 3:**

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

    Undergraduate junior female. No background in martial arts but is interested.

2. Recall the last time you attempted to join a club. What information was most important to helping you join?

    The GBody meeting times and any events they host. Where they meet and whether the club is closed (requires auditions) or not. Images are useful because you can see the people and if they are tight knit.

3. Recall the last time you attempted to join a club. How did you find out where the club was meeting and at what time?

    Went to the list serv from ClubFest. Their Instagram also showed the date and time (useful infographics).

6. How do you typically receive information about clubs in which you are involved?

    Most clubs have a weekly list serv.

7. Recall the last time you wanted to join a club. What aspects of the club made you interested in joining?

6. How do you typically receive information about clubs in which you are involved?

    Most clubs have weekly list servs.

7. Recall the last time you wanted to join a club. What aspects of the club made you interested in joining?

    They stayed in the club because it was well run. They initially joined because it was a similar club to one they joined in highschool and they were interested in the topic.

8. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?

    Nothing they could think of.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Get information on what Judo is

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include a section with images specifically about the history and description of Judo
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By including images it makes the description of Judo more interesting. Furthermore by having this history it will make it easier for the audience to understand what Judo is.

Goal 2: Get information on club logistics

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include an aside on the homepage which will show the dates and times of meetings. Furthermore there will be an updates section. There will also be a fax page which will probably include a dropdown menu.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By having this content front and center it is easily visible to the audience. This is important because it makes the content centralized and accessible which is important because finding out the club logistics is one of the key things audience members are looking for on the website.

Goal 3: Gain access to the weekly list serv for updates

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include a page which has the list serv linked at the top with directions in how to join. Furthermore, there will be a pdf embedded in the site that shows that weeks list serv, so that the new users can see the most recent updates without needing to join the list serv first.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By having the directions and the list serv people can easily follow the familiar design used by other sites of receiving a weekly email. By having the PDF embedded in the site, new users can see updates without having to sign up first.

Goal 4: Understand the goals and overall vibe of the judo club

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include a photo album section in the website as well as a goal section on the front page
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By having the goals of the club listed it makes it clear what the club is about. By including a photo album potential new members can see what the club is like and the vibe of the club.


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

Cornell students with an interest in practicing a new martial art who would like to learn about the Judo club. This audience is a cohesive group with regard to my website as it includes the backgrounds and the goals of all of the interviewee's in our sample size. Furthermore, the client wants a website to draw in new members so their wants follow the interests and goals of the interviewees.


## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://pedrosjudo.com/>

    ![Pedros gym narrow screen version](pedros-narrow.png)

    ![Pedros gym wide screen version](pedros-wide.png)

2. <https://cornellclubhockey.com/>

    ![Cornell Club Hockey narrow screen version](hockey-narrow.png)

    ![Cornell Club Hockey wide screen version](hockey-wide.png)

3. <https://www.teamusa.org/usa-judo>

    ![Team USA Judo narrow screen version](usajudo-narrow.png)

    ![Team USA Judo wide screen version](usajudo-wide.png)


### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The website appears to be a single page that has content load in as one scrolls. The wide screen has a menu at the top that drops down when the user hovers over it displaying further options. At the top is the name, and location and contact information. There is a background image with solid color blocks with text on it to contrast the text and the background image. This website does a good job of sorting the content and making it clear when there are divides. This is because the site uses a menu with a dropdown menu. Furthermore, as the user scrolls, the content gradually fades into existance so the user knows it is looking at new content. For the narrow page the page now has a hamburger menu as the menu. The content is separated into square sections as the user scrolls. The content is the same, however, but it makes the content easier to understand by separating it into sections.

### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The widescreen portion of this website has a menu bar at the top. As the user hovers over each item in the nav bar the nav bar is highlighted. Under the header nav bar is a slideshow showing images of the club. Under the slide show is information on the club and how to join. Other pages include the schedule as well as a 3x4 chart showing recent news. On each page at the bottom is the contact information and social medias. For the narrow page, the front page stays the same just shrinks down. The nav bar turns into a hamburger dropdown bar. As for the schedule and the news they turn into a column of information separated into different divisions with separations between the divisions.

### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

This page has several sections. For the wide version, in each section are different news articles that have two per line. The menu is a drop down that has section headers with dropdowns for individual elements. When the elements are hovered over, there is a cursor. One can move and scroll using the arrow keys. When the buttons are hovered over they highlight. For the narrow version the menu is still a dropdown. The news articles are now vertically aligned in a column running down the page, and the interactivity is the same as previously from the wide version.

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Text description of the history of Judo
- Images of the Judo club
- Homepage aside with information on the club dates and times
- Updates section
- Fax page that gives information on the club
- Contact section that allows for potential members to reach out to current members
- Photo album
- Club goal on the front page
- Embedded PDF of the list serv for that week
- Information on how to join the list serv
- Club member bio's

*UPDATE: We removed the images of the judo club because there was an overlap with the album, and made the contact section just a division with information

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

This content is right for the site's audience. This is because the content is inspired by interviews taken from the audience. The audience is potential new members of the judo club from the Cornell community and this content will help these new members connect to and join the judo club. The audience wanted to know more about the club, learn about judo, access the list serv, and get a feel for the club. This content will help the audience address these goals. The text description of judo and the images will help the user learn about judo. The information will help the audience learn about the club and will put the content front and center so it is easy for the user to find and access. The photos will help the user get a feel for the club, and the list serv will help the user view what the club is doing. Finally, the bios will be useful as many users join clubs because they have friends in the club and this highlights members of the club.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

- ![First card sort](first-sort.jpg)
  - For this card sort we started out with all of the content listed previously. The index page works as an introduction to the club, and that is where most of the content was stored. The next page worked as an introduction to judo. This is important because many of the interviewees stated they would be more interested in the club if they knew about judo. The third page was information about the club including facts and member biographys so that the user can learn more about the club. The final page was the contact page, which fulfils one of the goals of the users.
- ![Second card sort](second-sort.jpg)
  - For this card sort it is very similar to the first one. However, we realized the photo album already encapsulated the judo photos and so we removed that element from the home page.
- ![Third card sort](third-sort.jpg)
  - For this card sort, we first started by moving the contact information to the page with the list serv. The purpose of the list serv is to provide information to the users and so the contact information goes well with it. Also this makes it easier for the user to access the content that they need and it ensures the content is where they expect it to be. Furthermore, we swapped the positions of the judo page and the club page as it makes it easier for the users to find the information they are looking for faster. Furthermore it prioritizes the facts about the club which are more important to the audience when joining a club.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

The third iteration.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

The organization of the content fits the goals of the user well and groups like content together. The home page gives some insight to the user on what the club is about. Furthermore, it gives the audience the key information they seek when joining a club, which is the times and days the club is meeting. The second team page gives the user insight into the current club members as well as some facts about the club. This makes it easy for the potential new members to learn about the club. Overall this page provides the deeper content necessary for users who know very little about the club already, and helps the user understand the vibes of the club and what it is all about. The next page gives some insight into what judo is. The interviewee's mentioned that knowing more about judo makes them more likely to join the club and so this page serves the purpose of educating the audience. The final page connects together important information for contacting the club. Therefore this serves the purpose of allowing the user/audience to contact the club.

### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- Home
- About
- Judo
- Contact

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience.

The main goals of the audience are to learn more about the club so that they can join. These tabs make it clear what information are in what section. The about page gives all the information the user needs about the club. The contact page makes it clear how they can reach out to the club. Overall, these tabs make it clear where the content they need to complete their goals is located.

## Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences. Note the theme you selected for your site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

Our target audience consists of university students looking to join a club where they can have some fun and get exercise while learning a new skill. As such, we created three layouts based off of this idea.

- For the first style we decided to create a style that was very fluid. We examined the Pedro's gym judo website and saw that it was one long page. We wanted the page to be fun and use lots of colors and chose the same colors as Pedro's gym which was red, white, and blue. There were no real compartments and the content was sort of spread out. This was meant to create a fun and inviting open feeling which would cause members to join. Several interviewee's and audience members stated that the clubs vibe was important to them joining and this creates positive feelings.
- The second style takes the ideas of the first style and spins it to be more structured. To contrast the open and free idea of the first style, we decided to compartmentalize the data. Therefore, each layer of the page has a single element whether that is a carousel or a text element. This makes the club seem more serious and more of a competitive club than an open gym. Furthermore it makes the content easier to view and understand which is better for the audience. The audience ultimately wants to find the content they are looking for and we think that this makes it easier for them to do so.
- The third style follows more closely the hockey example website. The first page has a carousel for the images at the top and then the text follows. For the next pages it is very compartmentalized however there are free elements such as text over the images. However, this gave too much of a strict serious feeling and as such we decided to change it around. We changed the color scheme to be red and white to match Cornell. We also spread out the elements with more white space to make the page seem more relaxed and less full of information. This was meant to make the page more readable for the user so that they could find the content easier.

Ultimately we decided to follow the second iteration. It maintains the fun and open feeling of Pedro's gym's website which is important to the audience. However, it also compartmentalizes the content making it easier for the audience to find and read the correspinding information. Therefore, the second element is the best of both worlds in terms of combining fun versus accessibility and readability.

## Design (Milestone 2)

Document your site's layout.

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- hambuger menu for the navagation bar in the mobile version of the website. It enhances the site's functionality by providing easier access of the nav bar inside the mobile version of the website.
- Image carousel for the picture album section. It provides a convenient way for audiences to view multiple pictures at once on the website.
- Hover feedback for items in navagation bar. It helps the audiences easier recognize which item they are choosing.
- Drop down text bars for the fax section. It helps simplified the contents within the page and each audience can click on what they want to know to see more specific infomation.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

For the wide ones, we have two different layout sketches for each pages. They both have logo, name of the club and navigation bar on the top. The first layout has logo and name on the same row and navigation bar on the second row and they are all centered in the page. The second layout has logo, name and navigation bar on one single row. Following on the index.html page are both a full screen carousel. And after that, layout one has dates and times in the side bar, layout 2 has dates and times and also updates on the sidebar. For the team.html, the main differences is the layout of members bios. In the first layout, It takes a row for each member bio. In layout 2, they are display in 2 rows and 3 columns. For judo.html, the image display and interactiviity are different: layout 1 is thumbnail in 2 rows and 4 columns, layout 2 is a carousel. On the contact.html, the main part of the page is in column in the first layout, row in the second layout.

![team html narrow sketch2](team-narrow-2.PNG)
![judo html narrow sketch2](about-narrow-2.PNG)
![contact html narrow sketch2](contact-narrow-2.PNG)

The difference between sketch 1 and 2 in narrow home page (index.html) is that in sketch 1 the club goal and the update & time are shown side by side but in iteration2 it goal, updates and time are shown one by one. For the team page, sketch 1 shows 2  members' info and two questions in q&a in a row while in sketch 2 member info and questions are shown one in a row. For the about (judo) page the sketch 1 shows images one by one and the title and text content in history section is shownn side by side. In sketch 2 the images are sorted into a carousel and the title is at the top of the contents in the history section. For the contact page, the skectch one only provides the pdf's name and a download button while in sketch 2 there is a retangular pdf viewer for audiences to view the pdf inside the website.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> However, you don't need to provide layout/CSS annotations.
> Please, provide an explanation for each sketch.

**Narrow (Mobile) Design:**

![team html narrow final sketch](team-narrow-final.PNG)
![judo html narrow final sketch](judo-narrow-final.PNG)
![contact html narrow final sketch](contact-narrow-final.PNG)

Like the wide design of the website,every page have the same navigation bar with logo and the name of the club on the right on the same row. Instead of the buttons should have hover effect, there is a hambuger menu on the top right corner that contains all the buttons in wide design. In the home page, we have a carousel and the club goal, updates, dates and times coming one after one. For the team page, we have the bios displayers one per row and the F.A.Q. section with drop down text bar for answer after the bio. For the judo page we have a carousel and a text content of history. For the contact page, we have a pdf viewer at first and text contents about how to join coming after.

**Wide (Wide) Design:**

![team html wide final sketch](team-wide-final.jpg)
![judo html wide final sketch](judo-wide-final.jpg)
![contact html wide final sketch](contact-wide-final.jpg)
Every page have the same navigation bar with logo and the name of the club on the right on the same row, the buttons should have hover effect. On the homepage, we have a full screen carousel down the navigation bar and then club goal with updates, dates and times on the sidebar. In team.html, we have heading and bios displayed in 2 rows and 3 columns following the navigation bar. Following is the heading and Q&A section. The questions are clickable are answers dropdown. In judo.html, we have a carousel centered in the page and then the heading and text of the history of judo. On the contact.html, we have the PDF and text about how to join on the sidebar.

### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience.
> Specifically, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users?
> How did you employ **design patterns** to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

In order to create this site we utilized visibility, affordances, familiarity, and feedback. When one clicks on the nav bar they receive feedback as the page changes. When clicking on the buttons for the accordion there is a change in the arrow which denotes whether it is open and the arrow itself is an affordance. When the user hovers over buttons the cursor changes which is an affordance. By showing the change in the state of the accordion and the casousel there is also added visibility as the user can see what is occuring. The casousel and the nav bar take the common shape of those elements meaning that they are showing familiarity for the user and we are using common designs. Overall, we use markers aka affordances to show what can be intracted with, there is visibility with showing buttons and other things in interactivity, there is feedback with buttons, and familiarity is shown through common element structure.

Furthermore, throughout this design we used common structures to design the layout itself of the site. Many websites use structures that have horizontally aligned flex items that switch to columns upon the page resizing. Furthermore we show the images and the text in a common way. Overall the compartmentalized design follows many websites that are similar to our own. The pages are also named well so the user knows exactly what each page is. This means that the user will be familiar with the website and therefore the site overall is familiar to the audience.

## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

The hamburger menu bar is designed only to show in the mobile version of the website to give audience a easy access to the navagation bar on their phones. The carousel is designed for showing mutiple judo club pictures to the audiences at once. The audiences can have a better knowledge of the club after viewing the pics. The hover feeback is designed for increasing visibility for the navagation bar, which is important in interactivity design. The drop down text bar is designed to show few infomation to the audences at first to provide a simplified look of the page. The audiences can click the interested infomation in their own will to learn more about their desired specific infomation.

## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

- ![Home page interactivity](home-interactivity.png)
- ![Team page interactivity](team-interactivity.png)
- ![Judo page interactivity](judo-interactivity.png)
- ![Contact page interactivity](contact-interactivity.png)

The code/pseudocode/initial states are written below the drawings. The html and css elements are listed next to the elements, and as a whole these sketches tell how to implement the interactivity. This interactivity has accordions, carousels, and a hamburger menu which is adequate for our interactivity and group size.

## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

The client overall liked our idea and wants us to continue with the design. There were some features that required explaining to the client and some additional requests from the client. Overall the client thought that the design was a lot more modern and a major improvement over the previous website and liked the interactivity.

  - Asked for any extra critiques or feedback to add to the site
  - Stated could use some videos maybe or gifs for aesthetics
  - Discussed adding videos to the site, decided having the carousel would be more useful and not over the top
  - Stated maybe could add links to other judo websites under the judo page
- 6:45 end
