# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

We were between a film group which is run by a friend of one of the group members and a sports club run by a friend of a different group member. Ultimately, we chose our client as the Cornell University Judo Club. Furthermore, the client is not a member of our group although one does know them.

The client is an on campus organization that does not have a current easily usable website. The website was last updated over 10 years ago and is not interactive. Our goal is to redesign the existing site, however rather than maintain the previous code we are rebuilding it from scratch but making sure the new site contains all of the content from the previous site.

Original Site URL: [Judo Website](https://cornelljudo.wordpress.com/)

Major Pages:

- ![Main page](judo-main-page.png)
- ![About page](judo-about-page.png)
- ![Practice Page](judo-practice-page.png)
- ![Email Page](judo-email-page.png)

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

6. What are your goals for this site?

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

    To do this we examined the previous website together with the client. Using the information from the client and the previous website we decided that the idea of the club has not changed since the previous website was created. As such, the purpose is to teach Judo to Cornell students and Ithaca residents of all skill levels and ages.

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

    It is the only gym between Binghamton and Syracuse. It has club members from around the world due to it being related to Cornell University. Some current members are from Ithaca, Germany, Korea, and Hawaii. It is one of the oldest Judo clubs in the nation dating back over 40 years.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

    The design and structure of the current website is outdated and difficult to navigate; the information in the website is not very pleasant to read or user-friendly. The client wants the design to be more modern and the important content to be more available.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

    The client wants prospective Judo club members who are interested in joining the club to visit our site. Thus, our website's intended audience is prospective Judo Club members from the Cornell and general Ithaca community who are looking to join a judo club.

5. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

    Users can browse through infomation of the club such as practice, member bios, and sending emails and perspective intention of joining the club. The client mainly wants people to be able to find out current information about the club (for example shirt sales or club practice cancellations or times).

6. What are your goals for this site?

    The website's goal is to introduce the Cornell Judo Club's info to the audience, inspire new members to join, record daily activities of the club, and share Judo culture to the audience.

7. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

    The color palette would be mainly blue and white, the whole feeling would be more modern. This should match the themes as featured in some of the websites below that we looked up together.

8. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

    The three favorite competitors or similar organizations are Pedro's Judo Center, United States Judo Association and Kodokan Judo. Because the website does a good job on showing judo culture and engaging with the community

    - ![Pedros](https://pedrosjudo.com/)
    - ![USJA](https://www.usja.net/)
    - ![Kodokan](http://kodokanjudoinstitute.org/en/doctrine/)


### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

For our website, we want to design a site that fulfils the wants of the client. As such, our content will be our number one priority as well as its aesthetics. The client wants a website that mimics other judo sites as well so we will take a modern blue and white look into account. The Pedro site uses red accents so that is something we can incorporate as well.  The purpose of the site is to spread important information to the audience and bring them into the club. It is also to let potential new members reach out to the club to join. We decided to have a main page/updates page, an about us and info page, a practice and members page, and a contact us page. These pages will look substantially different than before but have the same info. Also the home and about pages before were the same so we are changing this. Due to these changes, rather than update a pre existing site, we opted to start from scratch. The images of the site can be seen here.

Original Site URL: [Judo Website](https://cornelljudo.wordpress.com/)

- ![Main page](judo-main-page.png)
- ![About page](judo-about-page.png)
- ![Practice Page](judo-practice-page.png)
- ![Email Page](judo-email-page.png)

For our site we plan to use the same original content with some new images provided by the client. We will make the site more modern and the content more accessible. We will also include an important info/ updates section.

### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Modernize existing website
- Draw in potential new members
- Give updates to existing and new members
- Allow new members to contact the club
- Have club information for all members


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

- As we have four team members we will shoot to complete the four sample pages we took from the initial website (home, about, practice, and email). We will do this by separating the current home page into a home page and an about/fax page. There are also several other pages which are highly interactive and beyond the scope of this assignment (a blog page and contact us PHP page). There is some content from these pages that can be added to our four pages, however. The four pages follow closely the original site and so it is the perfect size for our client. As it is the right size for our client it is good for this project. Furthermore we will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to follow the criteria of the project.

## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the site's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

Milestone 2 is due November 16th. It includes the drafts for the website's design and content placement. This closely copies our other projects initial milestones. Furthermore, we will begin our HTML and, time permitting, CSS.

For next week, we will have a design plan including a card sort and general layout design for both narrow and wide screens. Furthermore, the interview will be completed by then. By completing all design aspects and pre-draft aspects by next week, we will have an entire week to code our website. Furthermore, time permitting, we will add further design to our website by adding CSS.

As our final submission is the site that will be interactive, given our website is mostly done and our draft is done well we can spend time working on our interactivity and finishing the website for our final submission.

So, in conclusion:

By 11/4 we will have the design draft done as well as the interviews and goal analysis.

By 11/11, we will have our HTML and CSS draft done and our site assembled by each focusing on a single page (although ensuring the theme stays consistent across the site), and we will continue editing them until the final deadline on 11/16, to set us up well for solely working on interactivity and design updates for the final submission on 11/30.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** "Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am designing the website for the Cornell Judo Club.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Get information on what Judo is

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include a section with images specifically about the history and description of Judo
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By including images it makes the description of Judo more interesting. Furthermore by having this history it will make it easier for the audience to understand what Judo is.

Goal 2: Get information on club logistics

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include an aside on the homepage which will show the dates and times of meetings. Furthermore there will be an updates section. There will also be a fax page which will probably include a dropdown menu.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By having this content front and center it is easily visible to the audience. This is important because it makes the content centralized and accessible which is important because finding out the club logistics is one of the key things audience members are looking for on the website.

Goal 3: Gain access to the weekly list serv for updates

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include a page which has the list serv linked at the top with directions in how to join. Furthermore, there will be a pdf embedded in the site that shows that weeks list serv, so that the new users can see the most recent updates without needing to join the list serv first.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By having the directions and the list serv people can easily follow the familiar design used by other sites of receiving a weekly email. By having the PDF embedded in the site, new users can see updates without having to sign up first.

Goal 4: Understand the goals and overall vibe of the judo club

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Include a photo album section in the website as well as a goal section on the front page
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

Cornell students with an interest in practicing a new martial art who would like to learn about the Judo club. This audience is a cohesive group with regard to my website as it includes the backgrounds and the goals of all of the interviewee's in our sample size. Furthermore, the client wants a website to draw in new members so their wants follow the interests and goals of the interviewees.


## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://pedrosjudo.com/>

    ![Pedros gym narrow screen version](pedros-narrow.png)

    ![Pedros gym wide screen version](pedros-wide.png)

2. <https://cornellclubhockey.com/>

    ![Cornell Club Hockey narrow screen version](hockey-narrow.png)

    ![Cornell Club Hockey wide screen version](hockey-wide.png)

3. <https://www.teamusa.org/usa-judo>

    ![Team USA Judo narrow screen version](usajudo-narrow.png)

    ![Team USA Judo wide screen version](usajudo-wide.png)


### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The website appears to be a single page that has content load in as one scrolls. The wide screen has a menu at the top that drops down when the user hovers over it displaying further options. At the top is the name, and location and contact information. There is a background image with solid color blocks with text on it to contrast the text and the background image. This website does a good job of sorting the content and making it clear when there are divides. This is because the site uses a menu with a dropdown menu. Furthermore, as the user scrolls, the content gradually fades into existance so the user knows it is looking at new content. For the narrow page the page now has a hamburger menu as the menu. The content is separated into square sections as the user scrolls. The content is the same, howeve, but it makes the content easier to understand by separating it into sections.

### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

The widescreen portion of this website has a menu bar at the top. As the user hovers over each item in the nav bar the nav bar is highlighted. Under the header nav bar is a slideshow showing images of the club. Under the slide show is information on the club and how to join. Other pages include the schedule as well as a 3x4 chart showing recent news. On each page at the bottom is the contact information and social medias. For the narrow page, the front page stays the same just shrinks down. The nav bar turns into a hamburger dropdown bar. As for the schedule and the news they turn into a column of information separated into different divisions with separations between the divisions.

### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

This page has several sections. For the wide version, in each section are different news articles that have two per line. The menu is a drop down that has section headers with dropdowns for individual elements. When the elements are hovered over, there is a cursor. One can move and scroll using the arrow keys. When the buttons are hovered over they highlight. For the narrow version the menu is still a dropdown. The news articles are now vertically aligned in a column running down the page, and the interactivity is the same as previously from the wide version.

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.
> You should list all types of content you planned to include (i.e. text, photos, images, etc.)

- Text description of the history of Judo
- Images of the Judo club
- Homepage aside with information on the club dates and times
- Updates section
- Fax page that gives information on the club
- Contact section that allows for potential members to reach out to current members
- Photo album
- Club goal on the front page
- Embedded PDF of the list serv for that week
- Information on how to join the list serv
- Club member bio's

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

This content is right for the site's audience. This is because the content is inspired by interviews taken from the audience. The audience is potential new members of the judo club from the Cornell community and this content will help these new members connect to and join the judo club. The audience wanted to know more about the club, learn about judo, access the list serv, and get a feel for the club. This content will help the audience address these goals. The text description of judo and the images will help the user learn about judo. The information will help the audience learn about the club and will put the content front and center so it is easy for the user to find and access. The photos will help the user get a feel for the club, and the list serv will help the user view what the club is doing. Finally, the bios will be useful as many users join clubs because they have friends in the club and this highlights members of the club.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your **iterations** of card sorting here. You must have at least 2 iterations of card sorting.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting **and** description of your thought process for each iteration.
> Please physically sort cards; please don't try and do this digitally.

TODO: photos and explanations of each iteration


### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

TODO: tell us which iteration of card sorting you plan to use.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences.

TODO: why does this organization make sense for your audience (not you)?


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your website's navigation.

- TODO: page 1
- TODO: page 2

## Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 2)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain idea each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- hambuger menu for the navagation bar in the mobile version of the website. It enhances the site's functionality by prviding easier access of the nav bar inside the mobile version of the website.
-  Image carousel for the picture album section. It provides a convenient way for audiences to view multiple pictures at once on the website.
-  hover feedback for items in navagation bar. It helps the audiences easier recognize which item they are choosing.
-  drop down text bars for the fax section. It helps simplified the contents within the page and each audience can click on what they want to know to see more specific infomation.


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
> Sketch both the narrow and wide versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Include some of your interactivity ideas in your sketches.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

TODO: layout exploration sketches + explanation


### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.
> **Include your final interactivity in your sketches.** Include annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action with your interactivity.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> However, you don't need to provide layout/CSS annotations.
> Please, provide an explanation for each sketch.

TODO: 1 paragraph


## Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience and enhances their user experience.

The hamnuger menu bar is designed only to show in the mobile version of the website to give audience a easy access to the navagation bar on their phones. The carousel is designed for showing mutiple judo club pictures to the audiences at once. The audiences can have a better knowledge of the club after viewing the pics. The hover feeback is designed for increasing visibility for the navagation bar, which is important in interactivity design. The drop down text bar is designed to show few infomation to the audences at first to provide a simplified look of the page. The audiences can click the interested infomation in their own will to learn more about their desired specific infomation.


## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the HTML elements, CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

TODO: interactivity plan


## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

TODO: client feedback

TODO: meeting minutes


## User Testing (Final Submission)

**Conduct user testing with a minimum of 1 participant for every member of your team.**

### User Testing Tasks (Final Submission)
> Plan out your user testing tasks before doing your user testing.

1. TODO: task 1

2. TODO: task 2

3. TODO: task 3

TODO: add more tasks if necessary (a good rule of thumb is a task for every user goal)

2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site?

    > If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

    TODO: (Yes / No)
